#Arrays in Python are implemented using lists.
# A list is a collection which is ordered and changeable.
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
print(cars) #this will print entire list as single object

#Example 2
cars = ["Ford", "Volvo", "BMW"]
for x in cars: # this will print all car names one by one
    print(x)
